            <p>in a park, an adult <a href="page10.html">flies</a> a kite into a cloud</p>
            <p>who thinks it's a mushroom because a kid</p>
            <p>on the ground looked up and thought it</p>
            <p>looked like one and tried to take a bite,</p>
            <p>then found that it was too far to reach for.</p>
            <br>
            <p>the cloud thought the kid had waved so it</p>
            <p>tried to wave back and found that it was </p>
            <p>just a mushroom, it didn't have any arms.</p>
            <br>
            <p>and then: BAM a kite straight to the cap.</p>

            <p>those with ears noted the sound as, "less</p>
            <p>of a clap, more of a poof," but it tore that</p>
            <p>cloud apart.</p>
            <br>
            <p>the kid who saw a mushroom now sees a </p>
            <p>heart, and knows it's too far, yet still falls</p>
            <p>so hard, left with dreams of flying cars. </p>
            <br>
            <p>in the park, the adult who flew a kite all</p>
            <p>afternoon checks the note he attached to</p>
            <p>it to see if there was a response, but there</p>
            <p>was none.</p>
