        <p>way that the willow held its hands out</p>
        <p>over the dirt and through the pane.</p>
        <p>i tried to enter, but "left,"</p>
        <p>it only led to an exit!</p>
        <br>
        <p>so i guess i never really made it in.</p>
        <p>a swan's voyage song a maiden sings.</p>
        <p>i mistook a church bell for my cell phone</p>
        <p>ringing. i let it go to voicemail and listened</p>
        <p>to the message left, right away.</p>
        <br>
        <p>now i can only walk backwards.</p>
        <p>doors are always open when i </p>
        <p>approach them, and the room i enter</p>
        <p>is always the one i was just in.</p>
